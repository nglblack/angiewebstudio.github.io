User Experience Strategist and Data Analyst helping small businesses unlock growth through data-driven design and insights. I specialize in creating intuitive user experiences that are both functional and optimized for business success. By leveraging analytics and UX strategy, I craft solutions that increase engagement, streamline processes, and drive measurable results. When not analyzing data or designing, I explore astrology, grow microgreens, and pursue creative projects that inspire innovation. Letâ€™s work together to transform your business through smarter, data-backed decisions.
