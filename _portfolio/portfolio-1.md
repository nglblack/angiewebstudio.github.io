![hero image](\images\ticketeasecover.png)

---

## Overview

**Ticket Ease** is a high-fidelity mockup for an app designed to simplify paying traffic citations. The app helps users manage tickets by providing features for ticket search, court appearances, and payment plans—all with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.

### **Purpose**  
This mockup was created to address common challenges people face when trying to pay or dispute traffic citations, such as finding their tickets, scheduling court dates, and setting up payment plans.

## Project Details

**Project Duration:** 1 month  
**My Role:** UX Designer  
**Main Goal:** Design a mockup that simplifies the traffic ticket resolution process through a user-friendly interface and features like remote court appearances and flexible payment plans.

---

## Problem Statement

Many individuals, especially those with suspended licenses or financial struggles, have difficulty navigating the systems for managing traffic citations. Common issues include:

1. **Finding tickets online**
2. **Scheduling court appearances**
3. **Setting up affordable payment plans**

These hurdles often result in increased penalties, missed court dates, and ongoing legal complications.

## The Design Process

### 1. **User Research**
To understand users' pain points, I conducted interviews and surveys, focusing on how people handle traffic citations. Key findings revealed the need for clearer guidance, more payment options, and a streamlined process for court scheduling.

### 2. **Persona Development**
I created personas to represent typical users. For example, **David Hernandez**, a college student with a suspended license, needs affordable solutions and clear guidance to resolve his tickets and get his license reinstated.

### 3. **Wireframing & Prototyping**

#### **Paper Wireframes**
Initial paper sketches helped outline basic user flows and identify key interactions, such as searching for a ticket or scheduling a court date.

#### **Digital Wireframes**
I transitioned to digital wireframes to refine the app's layout and features. The focus was on making the ticket search simple and providing clear options for users to pay or schedule a court date.

#### **Low-Fidelity Prototype**
The low-fidelity prototype mapped the basic user flow, allowing users to:
- Search for their ticket
- View ticket details
- Choose between paying the fine or scheduling a court date

## Usability Testing & Refinement

After usability testing, several key adjustments were made based on user feedback:

1. **Payment Plans:** Users requested the ability to pay for multiple tickets at once, which was added for convenience.
2. **Billing Section:** A billing section was added to the payment page for easier checkout.
3. **Court Scheduling:** Added a warning for non-compliant payment plans and an option to cancel court dates.
